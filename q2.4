->Direct Addressing Mode:
LHLD 8100  (Load HL pair using Direct addressing from memory location whose 16-bit address is denoted as a16. So the previous content of HL register pair will get updated with the new 16-bits value)
XCHG   (1 byte) (exchange the contents of H-L pair to D-E pair)
LHLD 8102  (3 byte)
DAD D  (1 byte)(It is used to add directly two 16 bit numbers)
SHLD 8104 (store H-L regiter direct)
